## üöÄ Installation

Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

    $ yarn add is-emoji-supported

Or install using [npm](https://npmjs.org):

    $ npm i is-emoji-supported

## üñ•Ô∏è How to use

### Basic usage

The most basic usage is to use the function directly to detect is the current device support the emoji.

```ts
import { isEmojiSupported } from "is-emoji-supported";

if (isEmojiSupported("ü¶Ñ")) {
  alert("Houra ü¶Ñ is supported");
} else {
  alert("No support for unicorn emoji yet");
}
```

### Usage with your own cache handler

This library is doing pixel comparison to determine if an emoji is supported. This check can be slow so there is a memory cache implemented.
For some reasons you may want to use your own cache implementation to store the result in either localStorage, IndexedDB or anything else for persistent cache.
You only need to match the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Objets_globaux/Map) interface.

```ts
import { setCacheHandler } from "is-emoji-supported";

const key = "emoji-cache";
const cache = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key) || {});

setCacheHandler({
  has: (unicode: string) => unicode in cache,
  get: (unicode: string) => cache[unicode],
  set: (unicode: string, supported: boolean) => {
    cache[unicode] = supported;
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(cache));
  },
});
```

### Fallback to images

In most of the cases, you will want to fallback to images to handle unsupported emojis. The best way for this is to build an object with a fallback to all supported images.
You can build your own or use the one given by [JoyPixel](https://www.joypixels.com/), [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) or others services.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {isEmojiSupported} from 'is-emoji-supported';

const emojiMap = {
  'ü¶Ñ': {
    alt: 'unicorn',
    src: '/images/unicorn.png'
  },
  ...
};

export const Emoji = ({ unicode }) => {
  const attrs = emojiMap[unicode];

  return !attrs ? null : isEmojiSupported(unicode) ? (
    <span role="img" aria-label={attrs.alt}>
      {unicode}
    </span>
  ) : (
    <img {...attrs} />
  );
};
```
